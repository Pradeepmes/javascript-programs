I listed basic answers like lazy loading and splitting bundles. But they pushed me further: “Why do these techniques work?” That’s when I realized I needed to understand concepts like rendering cycles and browser behavior.

2️“What happens when you type a URL and press Enter?”
This wasn’t just about frontend—it was about understanding the entire web stack. I learned to explain DNS resolution, server requests, and rendering pipelines.

3️“How do you approach debugging?”
They didn’t care about tools—they wanted to see my thought process. It taught me that structured debugging (e.g., isolating issues step-by-step) is more valuable than memorizing solutions.

intuit(third party)
1) find duplicate
2) Write a function

deepEqual(obj1, obj2)

that takes in two objects as arguments and returns true if they are deeply equal (have the same properties with the same values), and false otherwise. The function should handle properties with object or array values recursively.
 
Example:
 
const obj1 = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown',
    state: 'CA'
  },
  hobbies: ['reading', 'traveling', 'music']
};

const obj2 = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown',
    state: 'CA'
  },
  hobbies: ['reading', 'traveling', 'music']

};

4)swap two string without using 3rd varibale

Ans) let str = "hello";
let data = "string";
[str, data] = [data, str];
console.log(str)
console.log(data)


9) debouncing and throtlling
10) how to handle props
Ans: "In React, props are used to pass data from a parent to a child component. We can destructure props, use default values, 
enforce type checking with prop-types, pass functions as callbacks, and optimize renders with React.memo(). Props help create reusable, dynamic components."


11) write HOC syntax
12) write context API syntax
13) how to pass data from two different component
14) what is proxy object
Ans: proxy object is used to create object that can be used in place of original object

15) what event.current atrget and event.target ->
Ans: event.target targets the child element (where the event occurred)
	 event.currentTarget targets the parent element (where the event listener is attached)
	   
16)what is event delegation.limitation of it
ANS:-> Event delegation is a powerful technique that allows you to handle events efficiently by 
       using a single event listener on a parent element, rather than attaching listeners to each individual child element
	   
	   limitations: related to event targeting, performance with deeply nested elements
17)   event bubbling or event capturing
Ans-> event capturing:- The event is caught first by the outermost element and travels down to the innermost element.

      <div class="parent">
		  <button class="child">Click Me</button>
		</div>

		<script>
		  const parent = document.querySelector('.parent');
		  const button = document.querySelector('.child');

		  parent.addEventListener('click', function() {
			console.log('Parent clicked');
		  }, true);  // `true` enables capturing

		  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
			console.log('Button clicked');
		  });
		</script>

      event bubbling:-event target at the innermost element and "bubbles up" to the root element
	  <div class="parent">
		  <button class="child">Click Me</button>
		</div>

		<script>
		  const parent = document.querySelector('.parent');
		  const button = document.querySelector('.child');

		  parent.addEventListener('click', function() {
			console.log('Parent clicked');
		  });

		  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
			console.log('Button clicked');
		  });
		</script>
